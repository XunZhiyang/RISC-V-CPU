2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 and clk_out1_clk_wiz_0_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0_1 and clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0_1] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0]
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-6#1 Warning
Timing of a block RAM might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance ram0/ram_bram/ram_reg_1_0, implemented as a block RAM, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-6#2 Warning
Timing of a block RAM might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance ram0/ram_bram/ram_reg_1_1, implemented as a block RAM, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-6#3 Warning
Timing of a block RAM might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance ram0/ram_bram/ram_reg_1_3, implemented as a block RAM, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-6#4 Warning
Timing of a block RAM might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance ram0/ram_bram/ram_reg_1_4, implemented as a block RAM, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-6#5 Warning
Timing of a block RAM might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance ram0/ram_bram/ram_reg_1_6, implemented as a block RAM, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-6#6 Warning
Timing of a block RAM might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance ram0/ram_bram/ram_reg_3_1, implemented as a block RAM, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-6#7 Warning
Timing of a block RAM might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance ram0/ram_bram/ram_reg_3_5, implemented as a block RAM, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on Rx relative to clock(s) EXCLK, sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on btnC relative to clock(s) EXCLK, sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on Tx relative to clock(s) EXCLK, sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#4 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on led relative to clock(s) EXCLK, sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>
